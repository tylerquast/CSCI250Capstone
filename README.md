# TODO
This section will be removed as they are completed:

- Everything completed is theoretical, I have no proof any of this works. I need a rasp pi with connects to test the for loops and arrays are set up correctly as I plan to index them. I will do that as soon as I get back to golden
- Add more effects (Lets shoot for 5 (1/5 Completed))
- Implement the sparkfun sound detector
- Implement the usb audio source
- Fix the readme to be presentable (This document)

To add more classes follow the same format as the examples already provited. an array of LED objects must be passed to each effect and should be worked with as a normal 3 dimensional array.
